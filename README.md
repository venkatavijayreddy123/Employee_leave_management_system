<h1>Leave Management System</h1>

<p>The Employee Leave Management System is a Java-based web application that allows employees to apply for leaves and lets administrators manage, approve, or reject those leave requests. The system is built using:

Java Servlets & JSP

JDBC for database connectivity

MySQL as the backend database

HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend

Apache Tomcat for server deployment

It follows a role-based login system, where employees and admins see different dashboards depending on their roles.</p>
